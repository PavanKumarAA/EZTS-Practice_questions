Key points

1. It's easy to learn
2. High level object oriented programming language
3. No need to declare a variable and no need to declare with a specific data type

Space complexity: the amount of space utilised by the CPU to compile and run your program.
efficiency: taking less space and less time to execute a task

LINEAR: O(n)
BINARY SEARCH: O(log(n))
-------------------------
Merge: O(n*log(n))
Quick: O(n*log(n))
